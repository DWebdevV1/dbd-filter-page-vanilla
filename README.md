# Dead By Daylight Filter page with Vanilla JS 
### This project is all about some DOM manipulation with vanilla JS (SPA approach).
#### There is no focus on performance or something like that

## Features of this App
- Using the FETCH API to make backend calls (REST-API)
- Client filtering and input search
- FlexBox
- CSS Animations / Transitions
- SPA approach (only one HTML file (index.html))
- Vanilla JS modal approach
- Playing audio files with event listeners
- Replacing content with JS (DOM / BOM)
- and more...

## Frontend

### For the frontend we are using serve (npm serve package) to serve the FE folder
- serve *APPNAME* (on Port 3000 or change it if you want)
- (serve ./Frontend) (default port 3000)

## Backend

### For this App we are using a "fake backend" (json-server)
Feel free to add your own backend REST-API here instead
- json-server --watch ./backend/app-data.json -- --port=5555

## TO-DO

- Load Images from backend
- refactor frontend js code (initializing survivors / killers / maps)
- survivor & killer modals (info cards)
- create home / main page
- create video background on main page

## TO-DO-LATER

- refactor killer theme (music)
- create repository on GitHub
- Replace fake backend rest api with nodeJs backend (express & mongodb)
- use webpack bundler (maybe)
